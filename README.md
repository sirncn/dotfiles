### Install

This playbook includes a custom shell script located at `bin/dotfiles`. This script is added to your $PATH after installation and can be run multiple times while making sure any Ansible dependencies are installed and updated.

This shell script is also used to initialize your environment after bootstrapping your `supported-OS` and performing a full system upgrade as mentioned above.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirncn/dotfiles/main/bin/dotfiles)"
```

If you want to run only a specific role, you can specify the following bash command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirncn/dotfiles/main/bin/dotfiles | bash -s -- --tags comma,seperated,tags
```

### Update

This repository is continuously updated with new features and settings which become available to you when updating.

To update your environment run the `dotfiles` command in your shell:

```bash
dotfiles
```

This will handle the following tasks:

- Verify Ansible is up-to-date
- Clone this repository locally to `~/.dotfiles`
- Verify any `ansible-galaxy` plugins are updated
- Run this playbook with the values in `~/.config/dotfiles/group_vars/all.yaml`

This `dotfiles` command is available to you after the first use of this repo, as it adds this repo's `bin` directory to your path, allowing you to call `dotfiles` from anywhere.

Any flags or arguments you pass to the `dotfiles` command are passed as-is to the `ansible-playbook` command.

For Example: Running the tmux tag with verbosity
```bash
dotfiles -t tmux -vvv
```

As an added bonus, the tags have tab completion!
```bash
dotfiles -t <tab><tab>
dotfiles -t t<tab>
dotfiles -t ne<tab>
```
